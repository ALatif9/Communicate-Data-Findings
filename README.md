## Summary of Findings

Univariate Exploration:

- We know the distribution appears to be closer to the normal 
  distribution.
- I found the number of bike trip by subscriber and customer 
- I found the Average of the Months trips.

 Bivariate Exploration : 
- I found Trip Duration in min VS Days , the relationship between user type and weekdays , trip Duration in min VS months.

## Key Insights for Presentation

- From that, we know that the subscribers are the majority with a great difference with customers.
- From that we see on Saturday and Sunday users use longer bikes than on the rest of the week.
- We have seen that the customers often use the bike for a much longer duration than subscribers. 
- From that we can make some assumptions and may lead to some insights that we can benefit from.
